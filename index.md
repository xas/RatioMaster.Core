## Welcome to RatioMaster.Core

RatioMaster.Core is originally a fork from [RatioMaster.NET](https://github.com/NikolayIT/RatioMaster.NET).  

This project is a personal one to test my skills and improve them.

### Goals

The fork of this project aims to differents goals :  
* Migrate to the latest .NET version (.NET Core 3)  
* Refactor most part of the code using _up-to-date_ knowledge  
* Migrate from a WinForm application to a ASP.NET MVC application with a `IHostedService` running in the background

### Compilation  

You need at least .NET Core 3.0.  
You can download the source and compile the solution with Visual Studio 2019.  
I suppose JetBrains Rider should work flawlessy also
